        <h4>I felt like I needed to write this... 
            You're probably wondering "what is this website... it's so useless". 
            I know it's useless! 
            This is a project from 2021 that I (almost) abandoned. 
            This website is still running because it uses the same server to run it and a few other things. A minecraft server, <a href="https://cdn.atmerek.xyz" target="_blank">a file storage server</a>, an air quality monitor station and a few other things...  
            I hope this helped you understand the purpose of it.
            <br>(It was fun to create tho...)</h4>
